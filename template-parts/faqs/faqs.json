        "question": "How to top up my boiler pressure?",
        "answer": "Increasing your boiler pressure is a simple task that involves a few steps. First, you want to make sure the boiler is switched off and has had time to cool down. Then, find the filling loop, which is often found on the underside of your boiler. Carefully turn the valve to allow water into the system. As the water flows, you’ll want to keep an eye on the pressure gauge; a typical pressure reading is usually around 1-1.5 bar. Once you’ve reached the correct pressure, make sure to close the valve and then you can switch the boiler back on. If at any point you’re not sure about something, we recommend getting in touch with a professional like Heatplex to avoid causing any damage to your boiler."

        "question": "Nest VS Hive stats - what are the differences?",
        "answer": "Nest and Hive are two leading brands when it comes to smart thermostats, each offering its own unique advantages. The Nest thermostat stands out with its rotating dial and digital display, and it has the ability to learn and adjust your heating based on your habits. Hive, on the other hand, is controlled using buttons and provides a simpler display, and unlike Nest, it requires manual scheduling. Regardless of these differences, both thermostats can be controlled remotely through their respective apps and are compatible with most heating systems. However, it’s important to note that the specific functionalities can depend on the particular model of thermostat."

        "question": "Landlords – What's involved in a Gas Safety Certificate?",
        "answer": "A Gas Safety Certificate, also known as a Landlord’s Gas Safety Record, is a legal document that landlords in the UK are required to have. It includes a thorough check of all gas appliances, fittings, and flues in a rental property to ensure they are safe to use. This involves making sure that the appliance is operating at the correct pressure, carrying out a tightness test to check for any gas leaks, checking that ventilation is adequate, and verifying that safety devices are working properly. These checks must be carried out by a Gas Safe registered engineer. At Heatplex, we provide comprehensive services for obtaining a Gas Safety Certificate, giving landlords the peace of mind they need."
